# This is a modified version of [CFDEM](https://www.cfdem.com/).
# Author: Linhan Ge, School of Engineering, the University of Newcastle.
# Typical features:
## CFD-DEM solver with diffusion averaging method developed by [Sun and Xiao](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030193221500186X)
* Grid cells that smaller than particles can be used to resolve the fluid flow.
* Details can be found in the below paper:

 *Please cite my paper if you use the solver in your research.*

## VOF-DEM solver with diffusion averaging method developed by [Sun and Xiao](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030193221500186X)
* Gas-liquid-solid three phase flow solver capable of resolving gas-liquid interfaces using extremely fine meshes whilst guaranteeing physical particle dynamics.
* Details can be found in the below paper:

# Installation procedures:
* Install [OpenFOAM 5.x](https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Installation/Linux/OpenFOAM-5.x/Ubuntu).
* Install the smoothing curvature feature for interFoam developed by [Kevin van As](https://github.com/floquation/OF-kva_interfaceProperties).
* Install CFDEM as described in the [CFDEM manual](https://www.cfdem.com/media/CFDEM/docu/CFDEMcoupling_Manual.html) but using the CFDEM repository here and [LIGGGHTS-LG](https://github.com/linhanGE/LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC) repository (HPC branch). Noting that the folder name should be changed from *CFDEMcoupling-LG* to *CFDEMcoupling-PUBLIC-5.x*.
* Please set up your own cases following the examples in the tutorials.
# List of new solvers
* cfdemSolverDiffusion (CFD-DEM)
* cfdemSolverVoF (VOF-DEM)
* cfdemSolverVoFCyclic (VOF-DEM compatible with periodic domains)
